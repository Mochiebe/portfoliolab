<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
<p>Welcome to my portfolio. Here you will find things about a 23 year old interactive design student majoring in graphic design. I love sanrio, hanging with friends, and anything that is fuzzy.
<h4>Hobbies</h4>
<p>I enjoy going to the gym, playing pc games, drawing and animating, streaming gameplay on twitch, reading, and getting lost in the black void of tiktok videos.</p>
<h4>Current Goals</h4>
<p>I hope by the time I am done this degree, I'll be making emotes and custom commissions for the online gaming community.</p>
